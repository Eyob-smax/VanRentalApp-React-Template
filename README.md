# 🚐 Van Rental App Template

A **front-end template** for a modern, full-featured **Van Rental App** — beautifully designed and fully functional on the client-side.

This template includes login flow, host dashboard, van listings, and clean routing logic. It’s perfect for learning how to build a van rental platform or kickstarting a full-stack app.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a **template only**. It does **not include a database or backend integration**. All data is mocked or stored temporarily (e.g., in local state or localStorage).
